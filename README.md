## Inspiration
This project is the Week 1 project assigned to us by the MLH Fellowship 

## What it does
Our template is a solution that helps professionals secure work opportunities by providing an easily customizable and awesome looking template that will help them display their past works and give clients or employers more insight into who they are.

## How we built it
HTML, CSS, Flask, Jinja

## Challenges we ran into
CSS responsive design, github

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The styling, the design, animations, successful completion and performance of template

## What we learned
We got a more solid understanding of HTML, CSS, Python and integrating them together. Also using Github efficiently really helped us coordinate our efforts and made working together easy.

## What's next for Project H Squad Portfolio Template
We are scheduled to add our own individual information to the template as well as adding a database for the backend 

## Installation

Make sure you have python3 and pip installed

Create and activate virtual environment using virtualenv
```bash
$ python -m venv python3-virtualenv
$ source python3-virtualenv/bin/activate
```

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all dependencies!

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Create a .env file using the example.env template (make a copy using the variables inside of the template)

Start flask development server
```bash
$ export FLASK_ENV=development
$ flask run
```

You should get a response like this in the terminal:
```
‚ùØ flask run
 * Environment: development
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

You'll now be able to access the website at `localhost:5000` or `127.0.0.1:5000` in the browser!
